# Shah Research-Code Repository
### The current home of all code related to the NLP efforts of Dr. Shah et al. (excluding [eHostess](https://github.com/MMontgomeryTaggart/eHostess))

For Yushuai: The structure of the repository reflects the two main methods of the project, PyConText and Machine Learning. The repo is still a little messy, and there may be more sensible structures. Feel free to re-arrange if you think there is a more efficient organization.
