Round 5:

Shane's Suggestions:
1. The distance from the phrases "history of" or "denies" to be counted as negative are not long enough for notes that have run on lists in a single sentence. This resulting in phrases being counted as positive when they are a long list of negatives
2. I think "chronic" should be consider negative
3. I think "can result in" should be consider hypothetical and so be counted as negative
4. "Bleeding time" should be a negative phrase since it is a lab test
5. (-) needs to be added as negative
6. "Denying" needs to be added as negative
7. "Hx" of needs to be added as historical and therefore negative
8. Multiple bleeding events were identified in the patients allergy section of the note
9. "PMH" added as historical and therefore negative
10. "in the past" occurring a few words after a bleeding event. The events were historical but the rules identified them as positive.
11. "PMHx" could be added as a negative modifier
12. "unrevealing" could be added as a negative modifier. I noticed a few entries that noted imaging to be unrevealing for bleeding
13. "splinter hemorrhage" should not be counted as a bleeding event 


Using target-span splitter, counting missing annotations as bleeding absent using TargetsV7 and ModifiersV6:
After a brief and non-exhaustive search 8 words on either side was found to give the best results.
Using 8 words on either side:(precision, recall, fscore, agreement)  0.853107344633 0.794736842105 0.822888283379 0.780405405405
