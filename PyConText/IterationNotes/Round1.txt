Agreement using the target-span-splitter not considering DOC CLASS annotations or documents for which there were no mention-level annotations (recall, precision, fscore, support): 0.771186440678, 0.771186440678, 0.771186440678, 0.559585492228

Possible Alterations:

Targets to Modify:
-1. Add an optional hyphen to coffee grounds.
-2. add '[a-z]*' to the end of bleed to allow it to capture bleeding, bleeder, etc with span-based splitter, may contain modifying terms after the target which will not be grabbed currently. e.g. 1018
-3. Fix spelling of epistaxis, currently reads epistaxsis. e.g. 10642.
4. Consider adding ecchymosis. e.g. 10645.
5. Consider adding exsanguination, e.g. 10645 "exsanguination from head injury."
-6. Add optional hyphen to guaiac positive, e.g. guaiac-positive from 11055.
7. Consider adding "g positive" as option for guaiac positive, e.g. 393043.
8. Regex to cover "guaiac(+)", e.g. 542107.
-9. Alternative spelling of guaiac: guiac, e.g. 582899.

Modifiers to Modify:
-1. "if" is matching all instances of if, including the middle of words e.g. significant is being marked as "bleeding_absent".
2. Consider adding "negative" to the modifiers. e.g. Note 10992 "His head CT was negative for any intracranial hemorrhage."
-3. Consider adding "ddx" as negated existence, since it implies hypothetical-ness. e.g. 542107.
4. Consider adding "previous", e.g. 10162 and 11662: Has had previous episodes of gastritis and GI bleed. Marked by PyConText as bleeding present.
5. Consider adding "ago" to negative modifiers. e.g. 11515, GI "bleed two years ago."
6. Consider adding "suspicion" or "suspicion for" as negative modifier. e.g. 11662: "Suspicion for gastrointestinal bleed."
7. "unlikely". e.g. 393043, unlikely variceal bleed.
8. Consider adding "concern for" as negative modifier? e.g. 542107. "concern for DIC, TTP, or blood loss"
9. Add "r/o" as an alternative to "rule out". e.g. 582899.
10. Consider modifying "monitor for" to just "monitor", e.g. 702187 "Monitor wound site closely for signs of bleeding."

54182: She was transfused two units of packed rec blood cells for anemia due to blood loss and hemodilution.
414067: Though there is concern for possible DVT, could not get anticoagulated given elevated INR and GIB.
